	Trusted : aadlboolean applies to (all);

-- Security Classifications
--
	-- The security clearance properties include a primary 
	-- security classification (e.g. Top Secret, Secret, Confidential)
	-- and an optional supplemental security statement. 
	--	
	SecurityClearance: inherit aadlstring 
	applies to (system, device, processor, virtual processor, thread,  subprogram, process, abstract);
	--
	SecurityClearanceSupplement: inherit aadlstring
	applies to (system, device, processor, virtual processor, thread,  subprogram, process, abstract);
	--
	-- The secondary security clearance is provided in the event of multiple clearances 
	-- (e.g. a clearance from two different agencies.) The secondary clearance also has a 
	-- primary security classification and an optional supplemental security statement.
	--
	-- No assumption is made about the relationship between the Security_Clearance property 
	-- and the Secondary_Security_Clearance property.
	--
	SecondarySecurityClearance: inherit aadlstring 
	applies to (system, device, processor, virtual processor, thread,  subprogram, process, abstract);

	SecondarySecurityClearanceSupplement: inherit aadlstring
	applies to (system, device, processor, virtual processor, thread,  subprogram, process, abstract);

-- Information Security Levels
	--
	-- The information security level properties include a primary 
	-- security classification (e.g. Top Secret, Secret, Confidential)
	-- and a caveat (e.g. control markings) statement. 
	--
	-- There are no secondary information security levels or caveats.
	---
 	InformationSecurityLevel: aadlstring applies to (data, system, process, device, abstract);
 	--
    -- Information security caveats are treated as a single string.
	-- For example, a US information caveat value may be "//SI/TK//RELIDO"
	-- When the  security level and caveat classification are "Top Secret" and "//SI/TK//RELIDO" 
	-- this specifies the concatenated classification "TOP SECRET//SI/TK//RELIDO"
	--
	InformationSecurityCaveats: aadlstring applies to (data, system, process, device, abstract);


-- A security domain is the determining factor in the classification of an enclave of servers/computers. 
-- A network with a different security domain is kept separate from other networks. 
-- Examples: NIPRNet, SIPRNet. JWICS, NSANet are all kept separate.
-- Systems in a domain are tagged with the same SecurityDomain value 
	SecurityDomain: aadlstring applies to (all);


-- collection of application domains that the recipient is allowed to deal with. 
-- This can be certain types of information, e.g., personnel data, or 
-- certain types of system control, e.g., flight control vs. mission vs. entertainment
	NeedToKnowDomains: list of aadlstring applies to (all);
